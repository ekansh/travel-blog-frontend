      What created the biggest air traffic shut down in the last 50 years made the striking tourism boom this country. Yes that's+
      glaciers of Europe. So now you know why it is called land of Ice and Fire and I am a fan of Game of Thrones so "A Song
      of Ice and Fire". Talking about which it is also site of many Game of Thrones location.

      Remember the scene from Game of Thrones where Jon Snow and Ygritte hooks up in a cave. That scene is from the Grjótagjá cave,
      in the north of Iceland.

      Iceland has an extremely dynamic landscape and is in the mid of its own creation perhaps that's why it is also called the
      youngest country. Its landscape consist of hardened lava covered with moss, waterfall, glaciers, gushing geysers, hot
      springs, beaches made up of ice rocks and ashes. It has a stark beauty which is nowhere else on the earth. Remember
      this it has all of this in a very small piece of land.
